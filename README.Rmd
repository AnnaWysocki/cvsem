The **cvsem** package provides cross-validation (CV) of structural equation models (SEM) across a user-defined number of folds. CV is based on computing the discrepancy among the held-out test sample covariance and the model implied covariance from the training samples. This approach of cross-validating SEM's is described in @Cudeck1983 and @BrowneCudeck1992. The individual models are fitted via the **lavaan** package [@Rosseel2012lavaan] to obtain the model implied covariance matrix. The discrepancy of the implied matrix to the test sample covariance matrix is obtained via a pre-specified metric (defaults to Kullback-Leibler divergence aka. Maximum Likelihood discrepancy). The `cvsem` function returns the average discrepancy together with a corresponding standard error for each tested model.

Currently, the provided model code needs to follow one of **lavaan**'s allowed specifications. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of **cvsem** from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AnnaWysocki/cvsem")
```

## Example

Cross-validating the Holzingerswineford1939 dataset

Load package and read in data from the **lavaan** package:
```{r example}
library(cvsem)

example_data <- lavaan::HolzingerSwineford1939
```

Add column names
```{r}
colnames(example_data) <- c("id", "sex", "ageyr", "agemo", "school", "grade",
                            "visualPerception", "cubes", "lozenges", "comprehension",
                            "sentenceCompletion", "wordMeaning", "speededAddition",
                            "speededCounting", "speededDiscrimination")
```

## Define Models
Define some models to be compared with `cvsem` using `lavaan` notation:
```{r}
model1 <- 'comprehension ~ sentenceCompletion + wordMeaning'

model2 <- 'comprehension ~ meaning

           ## Add some latent variables:

           meaning =~ wordMeaning + sentenceCompletion
           speed =~ speededAddition + speededDiscrimination + speededCounting
           speed ~~ meaning'

model3 <- 'comprehension ~ wordMeaning + speededAddition'
```

## Model List
Gather models into a named list object with `cvgather`
```{r}
models <- cvgather(model1, model2, model3)
```

## Cross-Validate with K-folds
Define number of folds `k` and call `cvsem` function. 
Here we use `k=10` folds. CV is based on the discrepancy between test sample covariance matrix and the model implied matrix from the training data. The discrepancy among sample and implied matrix is defined in `discrepancyMetric`.
Currently three discrepancy metrics are available: `KL-Distance`, Generalized Least Squares `GLS`, and Frobenius Distance `FD`.
Here we use `KL-Divergence`. 
```{r}
fit <- cvsem( x = example_data, Models = models, k = 10, discrepancyMetric = "KL-Divergence")
```

## Show Results
Print fitted `cvsem`-object. Note, the model with the smallest (best) discrepancy is listed first. The metric reflects the average of the discrepancy metric across all folds (aka. expected cross-validation index (ECVI)) together with the associated standard error. 
```{r}
fit
```

## References

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
